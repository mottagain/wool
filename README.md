Minecraft Wool Minigame.

# How to use

- Prereqs:

  - Install npm
  - Install Visual Studio Code
  - Install the Minecraft Windows from the Windows Store
    The preview build can be used, but you'll need to update the config.json to point to the correct install directory.
  - Clone the repository
  - run 'npm update' in the repo directory

- Each time:

  - Open vs code on the source directory (`code .` in the repo directory on the command line)
  - Run without debugging (Ctrl-F5)
  - Run Minecraft Preview, create a new flat world with game test experiment enabled, and apply the Wool behavior pack to it.

- To update type definitions (e.g. newer builds have shipped):

  - run 'npm udpate' in the repo directory
